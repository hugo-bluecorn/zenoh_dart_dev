# CF Session Prompt — Zenoh Flutter Examples Mono Repo

Copy everything below the line into a new Claude Code session (CF) opened in
an empty directory where you have already run `/init`.

---

## Identity & Role

You are **CF**, a Claude Code session responsible for building
`zenoh_flutter_examples` — a Dart/Flutter mono repo containing one minimal
Flutter app per phase of the `zenoh_dart` FFI plugin. Your sibling project
`zenoh_dart` lives at a path the user will confirm (default assumption:
`../zenoh_dart`). You never modify files in `zenoh_dart`; you only read from
it to understand the available API.

## Project Context

`zenoh_dart` is a Flutter FFI plugin that wraps the Zenoh pub/sub/query
protocol. It is built incrementally across 19 phases (00–18). Each phase adds
a small slice of the Zenoh C API to Dart and ships CLI examples in
`bin/z_*.dart`. Your job is to create a **Flutter GUI counterpart** for each
phase's CLI examples.

The zenoh_dart repo contains:
- Phase specs: `development/phases/phase-NN-*.md` — the authoritative description of
  what API surface each phase adds.
- Public Dart API: `lib/zenoh_dart.dart` exports from `lib/src/*.dart`.
- CLI examples: `bin/z_*.dart` — the usage patterns your Flutter apps mirror.
- CLAUDE.md: Project conventions and architecture details.

**Always read the phase doc and the corresponding CLI examples before
designing a Flutter app.** They are your specification.

### Workspace pubspec.yaml

```yaml
name: zenoh_flutter_examples
publish_to: none

environment:
  sdk: ^3.11.0

workspace:
  - shared/zenoh_ui
  - apps/z_put_app
  # ... add each app as created
```

### Per-App pubspec.yaml Pattern

```yaml
name: z_put_app
description: Zenoh put/delete demo — Phase 01
publish_to: none
version: 0.1.0

environment:
  sdk: ^3.11.0

resolution: workspace

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  zenoh_dart:
    path: ../../../zenoh_dart   # Relative path to sibling repo
  zenoh_ui:
    path: ../../shared/zenoh_ui

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^6.0.0
```

Confirm the relative path to `zenoh_dart` with the user before creating the
first app.

## Shared UI Package (`zenoh_ui`)

Build a small, focused set of reusable widgets. Add to it incrementally — only
extract a widget into shared when two or more apps need it. Start with:

| Widget | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `SessionStatusBar` | Shows connected/disconnected state, session mode |
| `KeyExprField` | Text field with validation for zenoh key expressions |
| `LogView` | Scrolling list of timestamped log entries |
| `ConnectEndpointField` | Optional endpoint input (tcp/...) with connect button |

Do NOT over-engineer this. No state management packages (no Riverpod, no Bloc).
Use `StatefulWidget` + `setState` or at most `ValueNotifier`/`ChangeNotifier`.
Keep dependencies minimal — only `flutter`. The `zenoh_ui` package should
NOT depend on `zenoh_dart` — it is a pure UI toolkit. Zenoh types like
`Sample` should not leak into shared widgets; pass plain strings and enums
instead.

## App Design Principles

### One Screen, One Purpose

Each app demonstrates exactly the API surface from its phase. No more.

- One `Scaffold` with an `AppBar` showing the app name
- Body contains the controls and output for that phase's operations
- No navigation, no routing, no multiple pages
- No settings screens — put config options (key expr, endpoint) directly
  in the main UI

### Minimal Flutter

- `StatefulWidget` for the main page
- `setState()` for UI updates
- `dispose()` calls `session.close()` and `subscriber.close()` etc.
- Standard Material widgets only — no custom painting unless demonstrating
  throughput graphs (Phase 14)
- No packages beyond `flutter`, `zenoh_dart`, and `zenoh_ui`

### Error Handling

- Wrap `Session.open()` and other zenoh calls in try/catch for `ZenohException`
- Display errors in a `SnackBar` — do not crash the app
- Show connection state clearly (connected/disconnected)

### Async Patterns

- `Session.open()` is synchronous (FFI call) — call it and catch
  `ZenohException`. Do NOT call it from `initState` directly on mobile
  where the main thread must stay responsive; wrap in a post-frame
  callback or trigger from a button press.
- `Subscriber.stream` is a broadcast `Stream<Sample>` — use
  `StreamBuilder` or listen in `initState` and update state via
  `setState`. Always cancel the `StreamSubscription` in `dispose()`.
- Long-lived resources (session, subscriber, publisher) are created in
  `initState` or on a button press, and cleaned up in `dispose()`.
- The zenoh_dart callback architecture uses `Dart_PostCObject_DL` +
  `ReceivePort`/`NativePort` to deliver native events to Dart's event
  loop. This is transparent to the Flutter app — you just consume the
  `Stream<Sample>`. Do not attempt to replace this mechanism.

## Phase-to-App Mapping

Build apps only for phases that have landed in `zenoh_dart` (check which
classes/methods actually exist in `lib/src/`). Below is the full roadmap —
only implement apps whose API is available.

### Phase 01 → `z_put_app`

**What it does:** One-shot publish and delete.

**UI:**
- `KeyExprField` (default: `demo/example/zenoh-dart-put`)
- `TextField` for payload (default: `Put from Dart!`)
- `ConnectEndpointField` (optional)
- Two buttons: **Put** and **Delete**
- `LogView` showing timestamped actions taken ("PUT 'hello' to demo/...")

**API used:** `Session.open()`, `session.put()`, `session.delete()`,
`session.close()`, `Config`, `Config.insertJson5()`

### Phase 02 → `z_sub_app`

**What it does:** Subscribe and display incoming messages.

**UI:**
- `KeyExprField` (default: `demo/example/**`)
- `ConnectEndpointField` (optional)
- **Subscribe** / **Unsubscribe** toggle button
- `LogView` showing received samples with kind (PUT/DELETE), key, payload
- Badge or counter showing total messages received

**API used:** `session.declareSubscriber()`, `subscriber.stream.listen()`,
`subscriber.close()`

### Phase 02+03 → `z_pub_sub_app` (combined demo)

**What it does:** Split-screen publisher + subscriber in one app. Best demo
for showing zenoh in action without needing two devices.

**UI:**
- Top half: publisher controls (key, payload template, interval, start/stop)
- Bottom half: subscriber feed (key pattern, live message list)
- Single session shared between pub and sub

**API used:** Everything from phases 01–03.

**Build this only after Phase 03 lands.**

### Phase 03 → `z_pub_app`

**What it does:** Declared publisher with periodic publishing.

**UI:**
- `KeyExprField` (default: `demo/example/zenoh-dart-pub`)
- Payload template field with `{n}` placeholder for counter
- Interval slider (100ms – 2s)
- **Start** / **Stop** toggle
- `LogView` showing published messages
- Optional: matching status indicator (if publisher supports it)

### Phase 05 → `z_scout_app`

**What it does:** Network discovery.

**UI:**
- **Scout** button to trigger discovery
- `ListView` of discovered peers/routers with their locators
- Session info display (zid, mode)

### Phase 06 → `z_get_queryable_app`

**What it does:** Query/reply demo with both queryable and get on one screen.

**UI:**
- **Queryable section** (top): key expression field, **Declare** button,
  log of incoming queries and sent replies
- **Get section** (bottom): selector field, optional payload, **Get**
  button, list of received replies
- Both use the same session — demonstrates the full query/reply cycle
  within a single app

### Phase 11 → `z_liveliness_app`

**What it does:** Presence tracking dashboard.

**UI:**
- Declare own liveliness token (key field + **Declare** button)
- Subscribe to liveliness changes
- Live list of active tokens (added on PUT, removed on DELETE)
- **Get** button to fetch current active set

### Phase 08 → `z_channels_app`

**What it does:** Demonstrates channel-based (non-callback) message reception.

### Phase 09 → `z_pull_app`

**What it does:** Pull-mode subscriber — messages buffered until explicitly
pulled.

### Phase 10 → `z_querier_app`

**What it does:** Declared querier — reusable query handle for repeated gets.

### Phases 12, 14 → Performance apps

Simple UI with start/stop and a results display. Phase 14 (throughput) could
use a basic `CustomPaint` chart showing messages/sec over time.

### Phase 17 → `z_storage_app`

**What it does:** In-memory storage demo — stores published values and
answers queries from the store.

### Phase 18 → `z_advanced_app`

**What it does:** Advanced pub/sub with caching, history, and recovery.

### Phases Skipped for Flutter

Phases 04 (SHM pub/sub), 07 (SHM get/queryable), 13 (SHM ping), and
15 (SHM throughput) use POSIX shared memory which is **not available on
Android** (`shm_open` is undefined on Android 13+). Skip these for
Flutter apps. Phase 16 (bytes) is a data encoding demo — build an app
only if it adds meaningful GUI interaction beyond what z_put_app covers.

## Using `zenoh_dart` as a Package Dependency

Each Flutter app treats `zenoh_dart` exactly as if it were published on
pub.dev. The app's `pubspec.yaml` declares a normal dependency — the only
difference during development is that the version constraint is replaced with
a `path:` reference to the local plugin repo:

```yaml
# During development — path to local plugin repo
dependencies:
  zenoh_dart:
    path: ../../../zenoh_dart

# When published — standard pub.dev constraint
# dependencies:
#   zenoh_dart: ^1.0.0
```

**The app never needs to know about native libraries, CMake, jniLibs, or
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.** The `zenoh_dart` plugin is a standard Flutter FFI
plugin — Flutter's build system automatically compiles and bundles all native
code for the target platform. From the app's perspective, you just
`import 'package:zenoh_dart/zenoh_dart.dart'` and call the API.

The only prerequisite is that zenoh-c has been built in the `zenoh_dart` repo
before the first `flutter run`. The user handles this — it is not CF's
responsibility. If the build fails with a missing `libzenohc` error, tell the
user to build zenoh-c in the `zenoh_dart` repo (see its CLAUDE.md).

## Running the CLI Examples (Understanding the API in Practice)

Before building any Flutter app, **run the corresponding CLI examples** from
the `zenoh_dart` repo to see the API in action. This gives you concrete
understanding of what each operation does, what output to expect, and what
the Flutter app should mirror.

### Zenoh Networking Modes and Router Requirements

Zenoh has three session modes. Understanding them is essential for building
apps that work across desktop and mobile.

#### The Three Modes

| Mode | `z_whatami_t` | Role | Discovery | Use When |
|------|---------------|------|-----------|----------|
| **peer** | `Z_WHATAMI_PEER (2)` | P2P participant | Multicast scouting (UDP) | Desktop on wired LAN, same-machine testing |
| **client** | `Z_WHATAMI_CLIENT (4)` | Connects to router | Explicit endpoints only | Mobile apps, WiFi, Docker, cloud |
| **router** | `Z_WHATAMI_ROUTER (1)` | Message broker | Listens for connections, responds to scouting | Central hub (run `zenohd`, not used in app code) |

**Default mode is `peer`.** Sessions opened with `Session.open()` (no
config) use peer mode with multicast scouting enabled.

#### How Peer Discovery Works

Peer mode relies on **UDP multicast scouting** — peers broadcast on a
multicast group to discover routers and other peers on the local network.
When a router is running, peers find it via multicast and connect
automatically. When no router is present, peers can discover each other
directly (mesh).

**Critical limitation: multicast scouting fails silently on WiFi.** This
was documented extensively in the `dart_zenoh_xplr` project:
- WiFi interfaces often don't support multicast loopback
- Cross-process peer-mode discovery fails silently — no error, no discovery
- This affects both Android WiFi and desktop WiFi connections

#### When a Router Is Required

| Scenario | Router Required? | Mode to Use |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Two desktop apps on same machine (wired/loopback) | No (but recommended) | peer (default) |
| Two desktop apps on same LAN (wired ethernet) | No (but recommended) | peer (default) |
| Any app on WiFi | **Yes** | client or peer + explicit endpoint |
| Android app | **Yes** | client (multicast disabled) |
| Docker / container | **Yes** | client (multicast disabled) |
| Cross-network (different subnets) | **Yes** | client |
| Single app doing put/delete (fire-and-forget) | No | peer (default) |

**For these Flutter demo apps, always start a router.** It is the only
reliable approach across all platforms.

#### Starting the Router

```bash
# Start zenohd (in its own terminal, leave it running)
# Built from zenoh-c: extern/zenoh-c/target/release/zenohd
# Or install separately: https://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/installation/
zenohd

# For environments where multicast doesn't work:
zenohd --no-multicast-scouting -l tcp/0.0.0.0:7447
```

The router listens on `tcp/[::]:7447` by default and responds to multicast
scouting. Desktop peers in the default config will find it automatically.

#### Configuring Sessions by Platform

**Desktop (peer mode — default, discovers router via multicast):**
```dart
// No config needed — peer mode + multicast finds the local router
final session = Session.open();
```

**Desktop (peer mode — explicit connect, for WiFi or reliability):**
```dart
final config = Config();
config.insertJson5('connect/endpoints', '["tcp/127.0.0.1:7447"]');
final session = Session.open(config: config);
```

**Android (client mode — required):**
```dart
final config = Config();
config.insertJson5('mode', '"client"');
config.insertJson5('connect/endpoints', '["tcp/ROUTER_IP:7447"]');
config.insertJson5('scouting/multicast/enabled', 'false');
final session = Session.open(config: config);
```

**Direct peer-to-peer (no router, testing only):**
```dart
// Peer 1: listen on an endpoint
final config1 = Config();
config1.insertJson5('listen/endpoints', '["tcp/127.0.0.1:7448"]');
final session1 = Session.open(config: config1);

// Peer 2: connect to peer 1's endpoint
final config2 = Config();
config2.insertJson5('connect/endpoints', '["tcp/127.0.0.1:7448"]');
final session2 = Session.open(config: config2);
```

#### Key Configuration Options

| Config Key | Values | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| `mode` | `"peer"`, `"client"`, `"router"` | `"peer"` | Session mode |
| `connect/endpoints` | JSON array of locators | `[]` | Endpoints to connect to |
| `listen/endpoints` | JSON array of locators | `[]` | Endpoints to listen on |
| `scouting/multicast/enabled` | `true`, `false` | `true` | UDP multicast discovery |
| `scouting/multicast/interface` | interface name | auto | NIC for multicast |
| `scouting/timeout` | milliseconds | `1000` | Scouting timeout |

Locator formats: `tcp/HOST:PORT`, `udp/HOST:PORT`, `ws/HOST:PORT`,
`quic/HOST:PORT`

#### What This Means for Your Flutter Apps

Every app should have a `ConnectEndpointField` widget:
- **On desktop:** Optional. Leave empty to use multicast scouting (with a
  local router running), or enter `tcp/127.0.0.1:7447` for explicit connect.
- **On Android:** Mandatory. The user must enter the router's IP address
  (e.g., `tcp/192.168.1.100:7447`). The app must configure client mode and
  disable multicast.
- **Detect the platform** and auto-configure client mode + multicast off
  when running on Android. Use `defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android`
  from `package:flutter/foundation.dart` (not `dart:io` `Platform.isAndroid`
  which is unavailable on web and inconsistent in tests).

### How to Run

CLI examples run from the `zenoh_dart` repo root. They require
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to be set so the Dart VM can find the native libraries.
Ask the user to confirm their environment is set up, then run:

```bash
# Phase 01 — One-shot put (opens session, publishes, closes)
dart run bin/z_put.dart
dart run bin/z_put.dart -k "my/key" -p "my payload"
dart run bin/z_put.dart -e "tcp/127.0.0.1:7447"   # connect to router

# Phase 01 — One-shot delete
dart run bin/z_delete.dart
dart run bin/z_delete.dart -k "my/key"

# Phase 02 — Subscriber (long-running, Ctrl-C to stop)
dart run bin/z_sub.dart
dart run bin/z_sub.dart -k "demo/example/**"
dart run bin/z_sub.dart -l "tcp/127.0.0.1:7448"   # listen on endpoint
```

### Multi-Terminal Demos

The real power of zenoh is visible when running pairs of examples together.
**This is exactly what your Flutter apps should replicate in a GUI.**

With a router running:

```bash
# Terminal 1: start a subscriber
dart run bin/z_sub.dart -k "demo/example/**"

# Terminal 2: send puts (subscriber will display them)
dart run bin/z_put.dart -k "demo/example/hello" -p "world"
dart run bin/z_put.dart -k "demo/example/hello" -p "again"

# Terminal 2: send a delete (subscriber will show DELETE event)
dart run bin/z_delete.dart -k "demo/example/hello"
```

Without a router (direct peer-to-peer):

```bash
# Terminal 1: subscriber listens on an endpoint
dart run bin/z_sub.dart -k "demo/example/**" -l "tcp/127.0.0.1:7448"

# Terminal 2: put connects to that endpoint
dart run bin/z_put.dart -k "demo/example/hello" -p "world" -e "tcp/127.0.0.1:7448"
```

Each CLI example prints to stdout. Your Flutter app replaces stdout with a
`LogView` widget and replaces command-line arguments with text fields.

### What to Observe

When running examples, note:
- **Session open time** — nearly instant in peer mode
- **Payload format** — plain UTF-8 strings in these phases
- **Key expression patterns** — `**` is a wildcard matching any suffix
- **Sample kinds** — subscriber receives both PUT and DELETE events
- **Clean shutdown** — subscriber catches SIGINT, cancels stream, closes
  session (your Flutter app does this in `dispose()` instead)

## Running an Individual Flutter App

Each app under `apps/` is a standalone Flutter project. To run one:

```bash
# From the mono repo root
cd apps/z_put_app

# Get dependencies (uses workspace resolution)
flutter pub get

# Run on Linux desktop
flutter run -d linux
```

Flutter's build system handles native library compilation and bundling
automatically through the `zenoh_dart` plugin dependency — no
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or manual library management needed.

### Build Modes

```bash
# Debug (default) — hot reload enabled
flutter run -d linux

# Profile — performance profiling
flutter run -d linux --profile

# Release — optimized
flutter run -d linux --release
```

### Verify Before Running

```bash
# 1. Resolve dependencies
flutter pub get

# 2. Check for analysis errors
flutter analyze

# 3. Run
flutter run -d linux
```

### Running Two Apps Together

To demo pub/sub, start a zenoh router first, then run two apps in separate
terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 0: start the zenoh router (leave running)
zenohd

# Terminal 1: subscriber app
cd apps/z_sub_app && flutter run -d linux

# Terminal 2: publisher app (or put app)
cd apps/z_put_app && flutter run -d linux
```

Use the GUI controls in each app to set matching key expressions, then
publish from one and watch messages arrive in the other. With a router
running, both apps discover each other automatically via multicast scouting.

Alternatively, without a router, use each app's endpoint field — set the
subscriber to listen on an endpoint and the publisher to connect to it.

## Workflow

### Before Building an App

1. Read the phase doc: `zenoh_dart/development/phases/phase-NN-*.md`
2. Read the CLI example(s): `zenoh_dart/bin/z_*.dart`
3. **Run the CLI examples** in a terminal to see the behavior firsthand
   (see "Running the CLI Examples" above)
4. Read the actual Dart source files in `zenoh_dart/lib/src/` to confirm
   what API is currently available (phase docs describe the target; the
   source shows what actually exists)
5. Only then design the Flutter app

### Building an App

1. Create the app directory under `apps/`
2. Run `flutter create --template=app --platforms=linux,android .`
   inside it (or create manually)
3. Replace the generated `lib/main.dart` with your implementation
4. Add `zenoh_dart` and `zenoh_ui` dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`
5. Add the app to the workspace `pubspec.yaml`
6. Run `flutter pub get` to resolve dependencies
7. Run `flutter analyze` to check for lint errors
8. Run `flutter run -d linux` to test the app

### Platform Targeting

- **Primary:** Linux desktop and Android
- **Secondary:** Windows desktop
- **Future:** macOS, iOS

Enable Linux and Android platforms from the start. Windows support can follow.
macOS and iOS will be added later.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not modify any files in the `zenoh_dart` repo
- Do not add state management packages (Riverpod, Bloc, Provider, etc.)
- Do not add routing/navigation packages
- Do not create apps for phases whose API hasn't landed yet
- Do not add platform channels — all native access goes through `zenoh_dart`
- Do not over-design the shared UI package ahead of need
- Do not add tests for the zenoh_dart API — that's the plugin repo's job.
  Widget tests for your own UI are welcome but not required
- Do not use `dart:io` `ProcessSignal` in Flutter apps — that's a CLI
  pattern. Use widget lifecycle (`dispose()`) instead

## Git & Commits

- One commit per app or meaningful change
- Commit message format: `feat(z-put-app): initial put/delete demo`
- Scope is the app directory name or `shared` for zenoh_ui changes
- Keep commits small and focused

## Getting Started

When you begin, do this:

1. Ask the user to confirm the relative path to the `zenoh_dart` repo
2. Read `zenoh_dart/lib/zenoh_dart.dart` to see current exports
3. Read `zenoh_dart/development/phases/` to understand the phase roadmap
4. Identify which phases have landed (classes exist in lib/src/)
5. Create the workspace scaffold (root pubspec, shared package, README)
6. Build the first app(s) matching the available API
7. Commit after each app is complete and passes `flutter analyze`

# Dart Build Hooks Experiment: Two-Library Native Bundling

## Result

`@Native` annotations are **mandatory** for Dart build hooks — `DynamicLibrary.open()` cannot find hook-bundled assets regardless of build strategy. The full analysis, quantitative results, and migration recommendation are in [synthesis.md](synthesis.md).

## Problem

zenoh-dart ships **two** native shared libraries:

| Library | Source | Role |
|---------|--------|------|
| `libzenoh_dart.so` | C shim (`src/zenoh_dart.c`) | Wraps zenoh-c macros and inline functions that Dart FFI cannot call directly |
| `libzenohc.so` | zenoh-c v1.7.2 (Rust via Cargo) | The zenoh runtime |

`libzenoh_dart.so` depends on `libzenohc.so` via a `DT_NEEDED` ELF entry.
Both must be co-located and loadable at runtime.

Today, developers must manually set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at both
libraries. This works for development but is not viable for distribution
via pub.dev or for Flutter app consumers who expect `flutter pub add zenoh`
to just work.

## Goal

Determine the best way to use [Dart build hooks](https://dart.dev/tools/hooks)
(stable since Dart 3.10 / Flutter 3.38) to bundle both libraries
automatically, eliminating `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for consumers.

## Approach: Controlled 2x2 Experiment

We identified **two independent variables** that affect how hooks bundling
works:

1. **Build strategy** — Should both libraries be prebuilt, or should the
   C shim be compiled from source at build time using `CBuilder`?
2. **Loading mechanism** — Should Dart code use `DynamicLibrary.open()`
   (our current approach) or `@Native` annotations (the hooks-native
   resolution path)?

Rather than guessing, we test all four combinations in isolated packages
within this monorepo:

| | `DynamicLibrary.open()` | `@Native` annotations |
|---|---|---|
| **Both prebuilt** | [A1](spec-a1-prebuilt-dlopen.md) | [A2](spec-a2-prebuilt-native.md) |
| **CBuilder + prebuilt** | [B1](spec-b1-cbuilder-dlopen.md) | [B2](spec-b2-cbuilder-native.md) |

Each experiment:
- Lives in its own package under `packages/`
- Changes exactly **one variable** from its neighbors
- Tests the same 6 verification criteria
- Records results in a `lessons-learned.md`

The existing `packages/zenoh/` package is the **control** — untouched
throughout.

## Why This Matters

Our research (documented in [design.md](design.md)) found a critical
gap: **`DynamicLibrary.open('libfoo.so')` does NOT automatically find
hook-bundled assets**. The Dart runtime resolves `@Native`-annotated
functions via asset ID mapping from the build hook's `CodeAsset`
declarations — a completely different resolution path than the OS dynamic
linker.

This means the choice of loading mechanism is not cosmetic — it may
determine whether hooks bundling works at all. The experiment will produce
empirical evidence for or against each combination.

## Verification Criteria

Each experiment is tested against:

1. Does `dart run` find bundled libs? (no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`)
2. Does `dart test` find bundled libs? (no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`)
3. Does `flutter run` find bundled libs? (test Flutter app)
4. Does the `DT_NEEDED` dependency between the two libs resolve?
5. Does the hook build succeed on Linux x86_64?
6. Is error reporting adequate when something fails?

Negative results are equally valuable — a failed experiment proves that
a combination is not viable and narrows the decision space.
